1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?

Solution:

1) True
2) False

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?

Solution:

And , OR, NOT 

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean
values for the operator and what it evaluate ).

Solution:

True and True = True
True and False = False
False and True = False
False and False = True

True or True = True
True or False = True
False or True = True
False or False = False

not True = False
not False = True

4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
not (5 > 4)
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
(True and True) and (True == False)
(not False) or (not True)

Solution:

(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)  -> False
not (5 > 4) -> False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5) -> False
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5)) -> False
(True and True) and (True == False) -> False
(not False) or (not True) -> True

5. What are the six comparison operators?

Solution:

==
>
<
<=
>=
!=
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a
condition and when you would use one.

Solution:

= is assignment operator
== is equality operator

inorder to assign a value or data to variable we use assignment operator
a = 10

inorder to compare the value or data of a variable to the given data we use equality operator

a == 10

7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')
print('spam')
print('spam')

Solution:

spam = 0
if spam == 10:
	print('eggs')
if spam > 5:
	print('bacon')
else:
	print('ham')
	print('spam')
	print('spam')

8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints
Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.

Solution:

spam = None

if spam == 1:
	print("hello")

elif spam == 2:
	print("Howdy")
else:
	print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?

Solution:

ctrl+c

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________


10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?

Solution:

break will stops the  loop completly and control comes out of loop
continue will skip the current iteration

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?

Solution:

range(start, stop, step)
stop is exclusive

range(10)
here we are giving only stop by default start is zero
generates number from 0 - 9

range(0, 10)
here we are giving start and stop by default start is zero and step is one
generates number from 0 - 9

range(0, 10, 1)
here we are giving start, stop and step explicitly
generates number from 0 - 9

12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent
program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.

Solution:

for i in range(1, 11):
	print(i)


num = 1

while num <=11:
	print(num)
	num+=1

13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after
importing spam?


from spam import bacon

bacon()
