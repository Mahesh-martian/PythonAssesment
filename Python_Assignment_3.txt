1. Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?

Solution:

functions are reusable block of code so if we want to perform same operation again and again we can define a function and write the block of code call the function reuse it allover the program

2. When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?

Solution:

when we call the function
functioname()

3. What statement creates a function?

Solution:

def
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?

Solution:

function is defining the function which has return statement 
def func():
	----
	----
	return 

function call is calling the defined function using its name 
func()

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?

Solution:

global scopes is one throughout all the program

local scopes can be any number depends on blocks in program

__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?

Solution:

variables in a local scope will destroy

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?

Solution:

return is the keyword which returns the output of the function.  if function is having the return keyword
then it is producing the output.

No, Is it not possible to have a return value in an expression.
only functions can have return

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?

Solution:

No output will be produced it will be None
